# cr-schober-bonus-app

This is going to be a bonus-app for all employees of "Autohaus Schober GmbH & Co. KG".
The goal of the app is to establish a bonus point system in the company including partner companies.

The concept is simple:

- The partner company - the first of three roles in the app - by filling out a simple form on a landing page is able to send vouchers for its store to the Auto Schober database.

- Meanwhile the boss - the second of three roles in the app - on another landing page can give bonus points to his employees.

- The Auto Schober employee - the third of three roles in the app - then, if he/she has enought points, on a third landing page can acquire those vouchers.
